        The Magic Movies Cinema brand was launched into the Nigerian market in 2008, with its first 
        location in Lagos. By December 2011, Magic Movies Cinema had already served over 15 million 
        customers. Our cinemas are located in major cities across Nigeria, including Lagos, Port-Harcourt, 
        Warri, Owerri, Abuja, and Asaba. Our growth strategy is to expand into more cities in the coming

        Magic Movies Cinema is a prominent brand in the strategic Lagos market, with our current location 
        in Lekki situated at one of the countryâ€™s most popular shopping malls, offering over 800 parking 
        spaces and housing prestigious Nigerian and international retail brands. Our Lagos location was the 
        first cinema in West Africa to screen a 3D movie (Green Hornet) in February 2011, setting the pace 
        for immersive cinematic experiences in the region.
